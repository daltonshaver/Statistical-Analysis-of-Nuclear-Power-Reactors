# Statistical-Analysis-of-Nuclear-Power-Reactors

Complete project analysis current energy capacities and future projects to understand the growth and development of nuclear reactors in the world.
*Includes both SAS code and final report.

## Abstract

Nuclear energy has become an important concern in recent months due to the pressure of discovering cleaner, efficient, and sustainable methods of producing energy. It is important to understand both the current capabilities and future potential of nuclear reactors if nuclear energy is to play a key part in solving the climate crisis. This analysis aims to understand the growth and development of nuclear reactors since their invention. The purpose is to examine the characteristics of nuclear power plants. This includes the geographical distribution of reactors, efficiency of energy production, and operational lifespan. The ability to understand the future growth and development of nuclear reactors is essential in order to maintain a key source of sustainable energy.
